# 36 24 7

## What

A revival of fffff.at/36247, originally built by [F.A.T. Lab](https://fffff.at/about/) — the Free Art and Technology collective founded by [Evan Roth](https://evan-roth.com) and [James Powderly](https://eyebeam.org/artists/james-powderly/), who also created the [Graffiti Research Lab](https://graffitiresearchlab.com/blog/projects/laser-tag/).

## Why

I grew up in Memphis digging into the city's crunk and hip-hop legacy. The original 36247 was a tool that helped me get closer to that music — a rich Black cultural movement from my hometown.

Discovering F.A.T. in high school sent me to New York. I interned at [Eyebeam](https://eyebeam.org) in 2010 under [Kaho Abe](https://kahoabe.net) and met the crew at [F.A.T. GOLD](http://gold.fffff.at) in 2013. Finding other Southern kids who'd made the same journey, coding and creating to the same sounds — that shaped everything.

Since then, I've spent years collecting Memphis tapes and DJing at WBAR in New York and [WYXR](https://wyxr.org/) in Memphis. That work connected me to the artists themselves — I brought [DJ Spanish Fly](https://www.djspanishfly.com/) to New York in 2023 and 2025. Now I share airtime with him and others on WYXR. This revival commemorates that full-circle journey.
