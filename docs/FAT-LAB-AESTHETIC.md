# F.A.T. Lab Aesthetic & Philosophy Guide

*A reference for extending F.A.T. Lab's visual and philosophical DNA into modern projects*

---

## The F.A.T. Ethos

### "Notorious R&D"

F.A.T. Lab operated at the intersection of:
- **Hacker culture** - break things, share knowledge, distrust authority
- **Hip-hop** - remix culture, sampling, street credibility
- **Street art** - public space, accessibility, anti-establishment
- **Open source** - share everything, build on others' work
- **DIY punk** - do it yourself, reject polish, embrace rawness

### Anti-Surveillance Stance

F.A.T. Lab existed in direct opposition to:
- Corporate data harvesting
- Surveillance capitalism (especially Google)
- Walled gardens and proprietary systems
- Intellectual property maximalism
- The commodification of attention

**Projects like "FuckGoogle"** weren't just edgy names - they represented genuine resistance to the growing power of tech monopolies over daily life.

### The "We Lost" Acknowledgment

When F.A.T. shut down in 2015, they acknowledged:
> "Our adversaries have grown powerful and our methods outdated."

This wasn't defeat - it was honest assessment. The surveillance economy won that particular battle. But the spirit of resistance continues in projects that:
- Refuse to track users
- Operate without analytics
- Prioritize function over engagement metrics
- Give away everything for free

## Visual Language

### Typography

**Primary:** Monospace / Terminal fonts
- Courier, Monaco, Consolas, or similar
- Represents: hacker culture, rawness, authenticity
- Anti-corporate (corporations use custom sans-serifs)

**Secondary:** System defaults
- Whatever the browser/OS provides
- Represents: function over form, accessibility

**Avoid:**
- Trendy web fonts
- Anything that looks "designed"
- Custom typefaces that require loading

### Color Palette

**Core:**
```
Black:    #000000 (primary text, backgrounds)
White:    #FFFFFF (backgrounds, text)
Red:      #FF0000 or #CC0000 (accents, warnings)
```

**Extended (use sparingly):**
```
Yellow:   #FFFF00 (highlights, warnings)
Green:    #00FF00 (terminal green, success)
Blue:     #0000FF (links only)
```

**Philosophy:**
- High contrast (accessibility)
- No gradients
- No shadows
- No "design system" colors

### Graphics & Imagery

**Do:**
- Bitmap/pixel graphics (GIFs, PNGs)
- Glitch aesthetics
- Lo-fi, compressed images
- Screenshots
- Diagrams over illustrations
- User-generated content

**Don't:**
- Vector illustrations
- Stock photography
- Polished icons
- Anything from a design system

### Layout Principles

**Embrace:**
- Single column layouts
- Raw HTML structure showing through
- Visible borders and boxes
- Left-aligned everything
- Tables for tabular data (yes, really)
- `<pre>` and `<code>` blocks

**Avoid:**
- Complex grids
- Cards and shadows
- Rounded corners
- Micro-interactions
- Animations for decoration

### Interface Philosophy

**Minimal:**
- Only show what's needed
- No onboarding flows
- No tooltips
- No "clever" UX
- If it needs explanation, simplify it

**Honest:**
- Show the system state
- Don't hide errors
- Let users see what's happening
- Debug info is fine to show

**Direct:**
- Actions happen immediately
- No confirmation dialogs (unless destructive)
- No loading spinners that lie
- Fail fast, fail visibly

## Anti-Patterns (What F.A.T. Would Hate)

### Dark Patterns
- Cookie consent manipulation
- Newsletter pop-ups
- "Subscribe to read more"
- Fake urgency ("Only 3 left!")
- Infinite scroll designed for addiction

### Surveillance Features
- Analytics tracking
- User behavior monitoring
- A/B testing for engagement
- Personalization algorithms
- Social login (Facebook, Google)

### Corporate Aesthetics
- Bland sans-serif fonts
- Soft, "friendly" color palettes
- Rounded corners everywhere
- Empty state illustrations
- Micro-copy that's "delightful"

### Tech Bro Culture
- Move fast and break things (without thinking)
- Growth hacking
- "Disruption" for profit
- Venture-funded user exploitation
- Gamification of everything

## Applying F.A.T. Principles to 36247 Redux

### The Interface

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ARTIST: Three 6 Mafia  ALBUM: Mystic Stylez  TRACK: ...     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│                                                             │
│                        [ NEXT ]                             │
│                                                             │
│                                                             │
│                     ██░░░░░░░░  12%                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Elements:**
- Raw, bordered container
- Monospace info display
- Single action button
- ASCII-style progress bar
- No decoration

### The Experience

1. **No tricks to start** - just an honest "click to begin"
2. **No manipulation to stay** - leave whenever, no guilt
3. **No data collection** - we don't know or care who you are
4. **No engagement optimization** - skip or stay, your choice
5. **Pure function** - play random music, that's it

### The Code

- Readable source (no minification needed for small projects)
- Comments explaining the why, not the what
- No frameworks if vanilla works
- Ship the simplest thing that works

## Eyebeam Influence

### Institutional but Radical

Eyebeam provided F.A.T. with:
- Legitimacy (for grant applications, press)
- Space (physical workspace in NYC)
- Community (network of artist-technologists)
- Resources (equipment, servers)

But F.A.T. maintained:
- Independence (not beholden to funders)
- Edge (willing to offend)
- Speed (move faster than institutions)
- Openness (share everything)

### The Eyebeam Questions

When making decisions, Eyebeam asks:
> "Does this shift the imbalance of power?"
> "Does this contribute to a more just world?"
> "Does this challenge surveillance capitalism?"

For 36247 Redux, this means:
- Don't require login
- Don't track users
- Don't optimize for engagement
- Do make something genuinely useful
- Do share the source
- Do respect the listener

## Quotes to Remember

**On Openness:**
> "Copyfree and in the Public Domain. No rights reserved."

**On Speed:**
> "Release early, often, and with rap music."

**On Honesty:**
> "Our adversaries have grown powerful and our methods outdated."

**On Purpose:**
> "Enriching the public domain through the research and development of technologies and media."
